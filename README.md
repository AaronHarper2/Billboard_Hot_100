The Billboard Hot 100 year-end songs are reported in a tabular format on Wikipedia. Initially, a web scraping technique was employed to navigate through the webpage, extracting information such as the year of release, song title, and artist for the top songs spanning from 1960 to 2020.

After gathering the list of the most popular songs, a second web scrape was initiated to gather the lyrics. Using the artist and song title, the corresponding lyrics were taken from the Lyrics Translations website.
